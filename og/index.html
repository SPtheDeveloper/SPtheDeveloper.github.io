        <h1>But Why</h1>
        <p>I hear you ask. Well that is a long story and it goes like this. A few days ago light speed banananana dropped a link to her github page, I clicked on it but before I could see her handy work she nuked it. Nice. So I thought to my self, "I should learn to build a website!" I logged into github and made a github pages website and watched a video on HTML. I then thought to my self, "this is kind of trash; I CANT MAKE A VUNERABLE PHP FILE UPLOAD THING!" I found this very distressing so i thought "Hey lets try AWS EC2". @Me sent me a message in the discord and used the metaphor: "using aws for your first website is like using a flame thrower to cut grass" I ignored his advice but after setting it all up and starting a badly configured apache web server I realised what he meant so I scrapped it and made a digital ocean droplet. This time I was going to do it right I told my self. (I did it wrong). Some don told me to use nginx but i was like nahh bro. So I booted up a unbuntu droplet and installed apache2 set it all up again and then realised I couldn't use scp properly to get my files to the webserver easily because apache is like "HA NOPE!" I try to fix this issue by granting ownership of the whole /var/ folder to the www-data user. This goes less than well. I have no choice but to rebuild my droplet and start again. At this point @aperture joins the voice channel and this man is a webserver wiz. He helps me get a actual good nginx server up and running and I am finnaly able to start making my website after 2 days since I started the project.</p>

        <p>Now I know what you are thinking: Jack you are an absoulute nob. And you would be correct. But. I beilive in learning by doing not by studying which is why I decided to buy a domain and make a real website before actually having a working website or even learning HTML, CSS or Javascript. This is stupid you say. Well I say. <strong>What you gunna do about it?</strong></p>
