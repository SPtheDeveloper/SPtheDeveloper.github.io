        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I am a student in the UK with a passion for all things computers and infosec. I am interested in physical
            security and social engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
           From a young age I was interested in computers, I would sit for hours and make games on scratch and play
            chess as I was fascinated by how the computer could beat me so quickly. I only really got started when my
            dad bought me a raspberry pi to play with. The credit card size computer made me feel like a leet hacker, I
            would run crazy commands such as <code>cmatrix</code> and <code>lolcat</code>. Alas after a while these
            things became boring, I watched my last <code>sl</code> drive off the screen and I forgot about linux for a
            while.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few years later I was a fan of pewdiepie when I saw a news article depicting a hacker that had hacked 50k
            printers to print out a message reading "Subscribe to pewdiepie and unsubscribe from TSeries!" (Tseries
            being Pewdiepies's rival in the race to 100 million subscribers). Even though this hack was a simple shodan
            search and a few lines of code it inspired me and at that moment I decided I wanted to be
            able to do that. So I began to do CTF's under the instructions of the printer hacker: HackerGiraffe who with
            his newfound clout was teaching his twitter followers the tricks of the trade. I knew nothing but I was
            learning every day from anyone I could find.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was about this time when I found <a href="https://twitter.com/pyr0cc?lang=en">Ben Bidmead (@pry0cc)</a>
            on twitter. After shooting him a DM asking for some tips on getting started in infosec I was pointed to
            <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a>. "Hack your way in to join", this looked amazing but of
            course I barely knew how to send a post request so after trying and failing to <i>hack my way in</i> for the
            first and last time I turned to youtube looking for a writeup. This was wrong. It felt like I had cheated
            (which of course I had). Looking at the writeup totally ruined the challenge for me but now I had what
            looked like hundreds of challenges to try so I started looking at a box called Netmon and with a little help
            from Ben I had the user flag and soon after I had secured root. This was the best feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alas not long after this in one of the discord servers I was a member of I was threatened to be doxed by
            some skid. Of course this was empty but I was shook. I nuked everything and stayed away from my computer for
            a while, making sure to watch my back as I walked down the street.
        </p>
        <p>
            But of course after a few months I could not resist coming back when I stumbled across a cyber security
            course for high school students. I signed up and breezed through the early stages as I had already learned
            all the basics a few months back. When things became unknown again I turned back to discord and found the
            community discord server for the course. Here I learned the most as I was surrounded by people with the same
            interest in infosec as me.
        </p>
        <p>
            And that pretty much brings us to present day where I am still learning every day, but I guess that won't
            ever stop. I enjoy doing HackTheBox and making things for fun, I play the odd game of Call of Duty or GTA
            and I love talking to people about infosec.
        </p>

        <h3>JackBot</h3>
        <p>
            JackBot is a breath of fresh air for small discord servers who need a simple bot to help run their server
            smoothly without having to deal with complex web panels and configuration. If you have a small community and
            need to do a bit more as an admin than the built in discord functions, JackBot is for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            JackBot has various features to help you automate your server, such as autorole on join and easy to
            understand moderation commands and logs. JackBot also boasts various other commands such as minecraft server
            stats and polls, to give your server extra utility.
